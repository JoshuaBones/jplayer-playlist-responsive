# jplayer-playlist-responsive
Makes jplayer playlists reponsive to smaller screen sizes. Works in full screen too!

Add the dist-responsive folder to your project, then add this to your jplayer playlist pages<br/>
`<link href="dist-responsive/skin/jplayer.playlist.responsive.css" rel="stylesheet" />`<br/>

If you encounter resizing issues, editing the max-width value on the first line may resolve it.
